# perfect ðŸ˜Ž

Process Excel files with Clojure

## Disclaimer

This project, though very cool, has unfortunately slipped down in priority because of my work on [panthera](https://github.com/alanmarazzi/panthera). I plan to get back to this ASAP because I actually need this, but if in the meantime you'd like to try it out and contribute ideas (check [this issue](https://github.com/alanmarazzi/perfect/issues/1) to understand some of the angles we're trying to tackle with this), code and so on, please feel free to pop a pull request! :rocket:

## Usage

Very light API at the moment:

```clojure
(require '[perfect.reader :refer [read-workbook]])
(read-workbook "myfile.xlsx" :method :full :sheetid 0)
```
